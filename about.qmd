## Background

I'm a Strategic Management student at the BYU Marriott School of Business focused on solving ambiguous problems with structure, speed, and strong execution.

I'm working toward a career in management consulting (MBB is a long-term goal) because I want to learn how world-class teams turn messy business problems into clear decisions and measurable results. I'm especially interested in growth strategy, go-to-market, operations, and M&A.

Outside of school, I'm an entrepreneur and author. I've independently published fiction, built marketing strategy around reader growth, and explored acquisition opportunities for small businesses — experiences that sharpened my ability to move quickly, learn fast, and stay disciplined with data.

I'm currently looking for internship opportunities where I can contribute in a strategy, operations, or business development role while being pushed to think at a higher level.
