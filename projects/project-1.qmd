**Deployment:** Vercel

**Tools Used:**

## Product Requirements Document

**Product:** Tron-themed To-Do List Application

**Objective:** Build a visually immersive, fully functional to-do list app with a Tron: Legacy aesthetic, backed by a persistent database, and deployed to the web.

**Requirements:**

1. **Task Management (Core)**
   - Users can create new tasks via a text input
   - Users can mark tasks as complete/incomplete (toggle)
   - Users can delete individual tasks
   - Users can clear all completed tasks at once
   - Users can filter the list by All, Active, or Completed
   - Display a count of remaining active items

2. **Data Persistence**
   - All tasks are stored in a Supabase PostgreSQL database
   - Tasks persist across sessions and page reloads
   - CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) are handled via the Supabase JavaScript client

3. **Visual Design — Tron Theme**
   - Dark background with animated grid pattern evoking the Tron digital world
   - Primary color: neon cyan (`#00f7ff`) with glow effects
   - Secondary color: orange (`#ff6a00`) for accents and warnings
   - Typography: Orbitron (headers) and Rajdhani (body) from Google Fonts
   - Neon glow effects on interactive elements using CSS box-shadow and text-shadow
   - Title flicker animation for cinematic feel
   - Horizon glow effect at the bottom of the viewport

4. **Easter Egg — Light Cycle Game**
   - A hidden "Get Distracted" button launches a full-screen Light Cycle mini-game
   - Player controls a light cycle with arrow keys or WASD
   - 4 AI enemy cycles with independent pathfinding and aggression
   - Trail collision mechanics (hitting any trail or wall = game over)
   - Score tracking and "DEREZZED" count for eliminated enemies
   - Exit zone to return to the to-do list

5. **Technical Constraints**
   - Built with React 19 and Vite
   - Deployed to Vercel
   - No additional UI libraries — all styling is custom CSS
